# Hasir

> *"Hasır" means "woven mat" in Turkish — representing how we weave your schemas together.*

**A self-hosted Protocol Buffer Schema Registry**

---

## What We're Building

Hasir is an open-source, standalone alternative to [buf.build](https://buf.build) — a schema registry designed for teams who want full control over their Protocol Buffer ecosystem.

Built with the powerful [Buf](https://buf.build/docs/ecosystem/cli-overview) toolchain, Hasir provides a self-hosted solution for managing, versioning, and distributing your `.proto` files across your organization.

## Why Hasir?

- **Self-Hosted** — Keep your schemas within your infrastructure. No external dependencies, no vendor lock-in.
- **Buf-Powered** — Leverages the industry-standard Buf tooling for linting, breaking change detection, and code generation.
- **Schema Versioning** — Track changes, manage versions, and ensure backward compatibility across your services.
- **Team Collaboration** — Centralized registry for your organization's protobuf definitions.

## Our Vision

We believe schema management should be:

1. **Private by default** — Your API contracts are your business
2. **Simple to deploy** — Run it anywhere containers run
3. **Developer-friendly** — Seamless integration with existing Buf workflows
4. **Open source** — Community-driven development

## Project Status

🚧 **Under Active Development**

We're building the foundation for a complete schema registry experience. Stay tuned for updates.

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions, feedback, and ideas. If you're passionate about API design, Protocol Buffers, or developer tooling — we'd love to hear from you.
